# Fitz JCR Housing Ballot System
This is the code repository for Fitzwilliam College JCR's online Room & Housing Ballot System.

There is a long-term project to replace this system with a new system [here](https://github.com/fitzjcr/roomballot). This repository holds an updated version of the previous system which is in use for the current, 2022, ballot.

The app itself is written in PHP and is designed to run on the SRCF's web server, but in theory it should be easily deployed elsewhere too. The authentication uses the `$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']` PHP variable and is designed to work seamlessly with the Raven single sign-on service at the University of Cambridge, however it should be easily adaptable to any other kind of authentication backend.

Roomballot was written by:
* Charlie Jonas (JCR Webmaster 2016)
* Tom Benn (JCR Webmaster 2017)
* Daniel Carter (JCR Webmaster 2018)
* Kyle Van Der Spuy (JCR Website and Technology Officer 2021)

## Installation
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/fitzjcr/roomballot-old.git` in a terminal.
2. Edit `.htaccess.example` and `app/Environment.php.example` as necessary.
3. Remove the `.example` part.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the room ballot project, please see the new version's page [here](https://github.com/fitzjcr/roomballot). This version will no longer be updated, except for minor fixes to keep the system working until the new system is in place.
